DONE
---
filedb features
- scan all files
- archives get their unpacked structure added
- archives are also added like a directory
  (not as a file, since there might be dupes between packed and unpacked
   this does not lose generality)
- ignorelist for filtering out items


- for all files with hash suffixes in i:\seagate_3tb\sdd1\pics\pictures_from_old_sdcard_broken_s7\
  check whether they are in filedb with file stem


DOING
---

TODO
----
- implement shell mode
- implement delete with update of filedb
- sourcecode: harmonize dir and path names
- get rid of accessed (requires filedb migr)
- do not open pipes

FUTURE
---
Those would be easy to implement but not done since not needed.

- Change add to check if the file already present, so the same initial
  tree can be specified and it will pick up everything automatically.
  - Have option to hash and verify existing files
  - Prune removed files
- Add command to drop filedb
